## New Items and Tools:

### 1. **Saw** 🔧🌲

The Saw is a versatile tool used to create the initial mechanism and to cut down entire trees. Its efficiency increases with its level, allowing for faster and more efficient cutting. The higher the level of the Saw, the more efficient it will be at processing wood and gathering resources!  
Ideal for automating wood extraction and optimizing the production of mechanisms in your mod. 🚀

### 2. **Rubber** 🏭🛠️

Rubber comes in two forms: raw and cured. Cured rubber is essential for creating the Rubber Mechanism and can be used in other recipes in the future. A fundamental resource for advanced industrial processes!

### 3. **Bronze** 🔥⚙️

Bronze is a resistant and essential material in thermal engineering, being used exclusively in the creation of the Heat Mechanism. A vital component for those looking to improve their machines and energy systems!

## New Mechanisms ⚙️✨

This mod adds **7 new mechanisms** to the Create mod, expanding the possibilities for developers and players to create innovative experiences. These mechanisms are designed to increase the automation, engineering, and processing options in the Create universe, enabling the creation of more complex and efficient machines. 🚀

### 1. **Wooden Mechanism** 🌿⚙️

The Wooden Mechanism is the basic mechanism, serving as the foundation for creating simple machines and as the structural base for most of the other mechanisms in the mod. Essential to starting your journey into automation, it is a key component in the development of more advanced systems! 🚀

### 2. **Rubber Mechanism** 🏭💧

The Rubber Mechanism is the basis for copper-based machines and devices that operate with liquids. Essential for fluid handling and transport systems, it enables the creation of new machines specialized in hydraulic and chemical engineering! ⚙️🚀

### 3. **Zinc Mechanism** 🔩📦

Zinc Mechanism is essential for logistics systems, being used in the creation of machines and devices aimed at transporting, organizing, and automating resources. Essential for optimizing material flows and improving the efficiency of your factory! 🚚⚙️

### 4. **Heat Mechanism** 🔥⚙️

The Heat Mechanism is an expansion of the Rubber Mechanism, designed to be used in machines that operate at high temperatures. Essential for systems that require thermal control and efficiency in heating and melting processes, this mechanism is fundamental for the creation of high-performance machines in the thermal industry! 🌡️🔥

### 5. **Advanced Precision Mechanism** 🔧⚙️

The Advanced Precision Mechanism is an essential component for creating advanced intelligent filtration systems. Designed to offer greater precision and efficiency, it allows the construction of machines capable of performing complex filtration and material separation processes more quickly and accurately. Ideal for those seeking high-level automation! 🛠️🚀

### 6. **Computing Mechanism** 💻⚙️

The Computing Mechanism is the basis for item control systems, being a component capable of processing information and performing automated tasks. Ideal for automating crafting and other complex functions, it allows you to create intelligent machines that manage and organize resources efficiently and automatically. An essential pillar for those who want to implement logic and control in their factories! 🖥️🔧

### 7. **Ender Mechanism** 🌌🔮

The **Ender Mechanism** was created to allow for the **instantaneous transfer and manipulation of resources** across dimensions. While the idea of ​​instantly moving resources from anywhere may seem futuristic, the **Ender Mechanism** enables the creation of **machines that traverse dimensions**, transferring items and energies between them.  
The effectiveness and capabilities of these machines depend on your **ingenuity and design**, allowing you to create interdimensional transportation and automation systems based on your creativity and proper use of this mechanism. 🌍✨  
This opens up a range of possibilities for those who want to integrate and automate processes between different dimensions in Minecraft!

## Mod Recipe Settings ⚙️🔧

To edit the recipes for the CreateMechanisms mod, follow these steps:

1. Open the 'createmechanisms-common' mod settings page.
2. Find and edit the 'generateRecipes' setting, setting its value to `false`.
   - This prevents the mod's initial recipes from being generated.
3. After making the changes, restart the modpack to apply the new settings correctly.

This way, you can customize the recipes to your liking or create new crafting systems for the mod!
